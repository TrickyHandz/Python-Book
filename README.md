## 🧱 Project Overview

This textbook is built with:
- **Markdown** for lesson content
- **Jekyll** for static site generation
- **Brython** for running Python directly in the browser
- **HTML/CSS/JS** enhancements for layout and interactivity

Each lesson supports runnable Python code blocks, interactive learning, and a clean, responsive layout for desktop and mobile.

## 🗂️ Directory Structure

- `/lessons/` – All structured lesson content (organized by section and topic)
- `_layouts/` – Custom Jekyll templates for lesson and page rendering
- `_includes/` – Reusable HTML components (e.g., TOC, headers, Brython code blocks)
- `_data/` – Centralized lesson metadata (`lessons.yml`)
- `/assets/` – Static assets like CSS, JS, and images
- `README.md` – This file
- `index.md` – Homepage for the textbook

## 🎯 Goals
