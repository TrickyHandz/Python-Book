# Booleans

**Booleans** are one of the simplest data types in Python. They represent one of two values: `True` or `False`. These values are used for logic, conditions, and controlling the flow of a program.

---

## Declaring Boolean Variables

You can assign a boolean value directly:

```python
is_logged_in = True
is_admin = False
```

Make sure you capitalize the first letter—`True` and `False` are case-sensitive in Python.

---

## Using Booleans in Comparisons

Most often, you’ll use booleans with comparison operators:

```python
x = 5
print(x > 3)     # True
print(x == 5)    # True
print(x != 2)    # True
print(x < 1)     # False
```

These expressions **return a boolean value**.

## Summary

- Booleans represent truth values: `True` or `False`.
- They’re often returned by comparison expressions.
- Useful for decision-making and flow control in your programs.
