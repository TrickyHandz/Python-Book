## üêû Debug Zone - Floats and Unexpected Errors

In the real world, floating-point numbers are everywhere-prices, averages, measurements-and so are the bugs they can cause.

In this section, we'll look at a practical example involving budgeting and walk through a real Python error using something called a **stack trace**.

### üí∏ Calculating an Average - Practical Example

Let's say you're trying to average your grocery spending over a few weeks:

```python
expenses = [52.35, 48.90, 61.42, 0]
weeks = len(expenses)

average = sum(expenses) / weeks
print("Average weekly cost: $" + average)
```

#### ‚ùå What Went Wrong?

Here's the error you'll get if you run this code:

```plaintext
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "budget.py", line 5, in <module>
    print("Average weekly cost: $" + average)
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str
```

Let's break that down:

---

### üîç Understanding the Stack Trace

#### ‚û§ `Traceback (most recent call last):`  
This tells you an error occurred and Python is going to show you *where* it happened.

#### ‚û§ `File "budget.py", line 5, in <module>`  
You're looking at line 5 of your file, which is where the problem occurred. That's this line:

```python
print("Average weekly cost: $" + average)
```

#### ‚û§ `TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "float") to str`  
This is the *actual* error: Python is telling you it can't combine a `str` (the dollar sign part) with a `float` (your average number). That's what the `+` operator was trying to do.

---

### ‚úÖ Fix It by Casting the Float

```python
print("Average weekly cost: $" + str(average))
```

Or, even better formatting:

```python
print(f"Average weekly cost: ${average:.2f}")
```

### üß† Debugging Tip - Read the Whole Error

Beginners often panic when they see a long error message. But stack traces are like breadcrumbs. Start at the bottom and read upward:
- What type of error?
- What line caused it?
- What does Python *say* about the problem?

The answer is usually right there-you just need to slow down and read it.

---

### üö´ Bad Debugging Habit - Blaming the Wrong Line

Sometimes the real issue starts before the line where the crash happens. For example, if `weeks` had been 0, this line:

```python
average = sum(expenses) / weeks
```

Would've crashed with a `ZeroDivisionError`.

That's why it's helpful to check your input first and use `print()` to double-check assumptions while you debug.

### üß† Rubber Duck Reminder

Still stuck? Try explaining your code to someone-or something. Talk through your logic step-by-step, even if it's just to a rubber duck on your desk.

This section introduced stack traces and the importance of reading error messages carefully. In future lessons, we'll practice even more techniques to help you build confident, bug-free code.
