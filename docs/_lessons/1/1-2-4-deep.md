# 1.2.4 Deep Dive – Strings in Python

Strings are sequences of characters and are one of the most commonly used types in Python. Python strings support a rich set of operations:

## Indexing and Slicing

```python
greeting = "Hello"
print(greeting[0])   # 'H'
print(greeting[1:4]) # 'ell'
```

## String Methods

Python includes many built-in methods for strings:

```python
message = "hello world"
print(message.upper())  # 'HELLO WORLD'
print(message.title())  # 'Hello World'
print(message.replace("world", "Python"))  # 'hello Python'
```

## String Formatting

```python
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

Understanding strings deeply will help you process text and user input effectively in your programs.
