# 1.2 Variables and Data Types

## What is a Variable?

A **variable** is like a label for a specific spot in your computer’s memory. You can store a value there, and later access it just by using its name.

> _“Think of a variable like a street address. You don’t always say ‘1234 Maple Lane’—you say ‘my friend’s house’ or ‘the grocery store.’ The street address is fixed, but what matters is what it represents to you.”_

In the same way, when we use a variable in Python, we’re not thinking about where the data lives—we’re just using a name that makes sense in our code.

```python
student_name = "Alice"
print(student_name)
```

Here, `student_name` is the name we gave to a memory location where the string `"Alice"` is stored. We refer to it by name, not by the value directly. That name helps both us and Python access the data quickly and meaningfully.

## Variable Naming: Rules and Purpose

Python has a few rules for naming variables:
- Must start with a letter or underscore
- Can include letters, numbers, and underscores
- Are case-sensitive
- Can’t be a Python keyword (like `if`, `for`, `class`)

More importantly, variable names should make sense to *you*. Python doesn’t care if you name your variable `x` or `favorite_movie`, but your future self will appreciate good names.

```python
# Bad
x = "Tim"
y = 14
z = True

# Better
student_name = "Tim"
student_age = 14
has_permission = True
```

## Naming Conventions

- **snake_case** – Preferred for Python variables: `user_name`
- **camelCase** – Common in other languages: `userName`
- **PascalCase** – Often used for class names: `UserProfile`
