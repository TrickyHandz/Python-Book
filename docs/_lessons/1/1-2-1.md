# 1.2.1 Integers

Integers are **counting numbers**—positive or negative whole numbers without decimal points.

```python
score = 10
lives = -3
apples = 0
```

Integers are great when you’re working with quantities you can count. If you divide them, Python will promote the result to a float if needed.
