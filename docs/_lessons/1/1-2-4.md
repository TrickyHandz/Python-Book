# 1.2.4 Strings

A string is any text wrapped in quotes. It could be words, sentences, or even empty.

```python
greeting = "Hello"
name = 'Alice'
message = "It's a nice day!"
```

You can use single or double quotes, but they must match. If you use one inside the string, escape it or switch quote styles.

```python
quote = "She said, 'Hi!'"
escaped = 'It\'s sunny.'
```
