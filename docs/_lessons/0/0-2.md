# 0.2 Interpreted vs. Compiled Programming Languages

Programming languages are typically divided into two major categories based on how the code is executed: **interpreted** and **compiled**.

## Compiled Languages

A compiled language is **translated into machine code** by a program called a **compiler**. This translation happens **before** the code is run. Once compiled, the resulting executable can run **independently** of the original source code or compiler.

Common examples include C, C++, Rust, and Go.

**Advantages:**

- Faster performance at runtime  
- Easier to distribute as standalone applications  
- Many errors are caught during compilation

**Disadvantages:**

- Slower development cycle due to the compile step  
- Platform-specific binaries can complicate cross-platform support

## Interpreted Languages

An interpreted language is executed **line-by-line** by an **interpreter**, usually at runtime. There’s no need to compile the code ahead of time.

Examples include Python, JavaScript, and Ruby.

**Advantages:**

- Easier to test and debug, which is great for beginners  
- Usually cross-platform as long as the interpreter is available  
- Faster to write and tweak code during development

**Disadvantages:**

- Slower execution since it runs through an interpreter each time  
- Errors may only appear when that part of the code is actually run

## A Real-World Analogy

Think of it like this:

If you write a letter in your native language and have it **fully translated** into another language **before** sending it, that’s like compiling. The recipient gets a final, ready-to-read version, no translator needed.

Now, imagine having a **live conversation** where someone listens to you and **translates each sentence as you speak**—that’s interpreting. The interpreter has to be there the whole time to keep things moving.

Python is a little bit of both. It writes down a rough translation ahead of time—called **bytecode**—and then has a helper called the **Python Virtual Machine** that reads and runs that translation.

## Python’s Hybrid Approach

Python is technically an interpreted language, but it **compiles your code into an intermediate form called bytecode** (.pyc files) before running it. This bytecode is then interpreted by the Python Virtual Machine (PVM). So it behaves like a hybrid—it compiles behind the scenes but still needs an interpreter to actually execute the program.

## Quick Comparison Table

| Feature               | Compiled Languages | Interpreted Languages | Python |
|-----------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Pre-execution Compile | Yes                | No                     | Yes (to bytecode) |
| Execution Speed       | Fast               | Slower                 | Moderate |
| Platform Dependence   | Often yes          | No (with interpreter)  | No     |
| Error Detection       | At compile time    | At runtime             | Both   |
| Ease of Debugging     | More difficult     | Easier                 | Easier |
