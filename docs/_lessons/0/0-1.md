# 0.1 (Optional) A Brief History and Philosophy of Python

> This section is optional reading, but it offers insight into why Python looks and feels the way it does.

## A Little History

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** in the late 1980s and released publicly in **1991**. He wanted to build a language that was both **powerful and easy to read**, something that felt more natural than the complex syntax of other programming languages at the time.

Python’s name wasn’t inspired by snakes, but rather by **Monty Python’s Flying Circus**, a British sketch comedy show. Guido wanted the language to be fun to use, not just functional.

Over the years, Python grew rapidly because of its **readable syntax**, **extensive libraries**, and **welcoming community**. It became especially popular in areas like web development, automation, data science, and education.

## The Zen of Python

One of the key philosophies behind Python is expressed in a list called *The Zen of Python* by Tim Peters. You can see it for yourself by typing this into a Python shell:

```python
import this
```

Here are a few highlights:

- *Beautiful is better than ugly.*
- *Simple is better than complex.*
- *Readability counts.*
- *There should be one—and preferably only one—obvious way to do it.*

This philosophy shapes everything in Python, from how functions are written to how the standard library is designed.

## Python as a Community Effort

Python is **open source**, meaning anyone can view, use, and contribute to its code. It’s maintained by a group of volunteers called the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)**. Most of Python’s growth has come not from one company, but from people all over the world sharing ideas, writing tools, and helping each other out.

If you’re interested in open-source development, Python is a great way to learn how modern software evolves as a shared effort.
