# Testing Python in the Browser with Brython

Before you install anything, this book gives you a quick way to run Python code right in your web browser. Thatâ€™s thanks to **Brython**, a tool that lets Python run in the same place as JavaScriptâ€”directly inside a webpage.

## What is Brython?

**Brython** (short for "Browser Python") is an implementation of Python that runs in the browser using JavaScript. It allows you to write and test small pieces of Python code without installing anything on your computer.

This is especially useful at the beginning of the course when you want to try things out quickly without setting up a full development environment.

## How We're Using Brython

In this book, you'll occasionally see embedded Python editors that let you write code, press a button, and see the results instantly. These editors are powered by Brython and are great for:

- Testing one-liners and basic functions.
- Exploring syntax.
- Understanding new concepts as you learn them.

## Limitations of Brython

While Brython is great for learning, it **does not** fully replace a standard Python installation. Some limitations include:

- Not all standard libraries are supported.
- File access, system operations, and external modules wonâ€™t work as expected.
- You canâ€™t install third-party libraries like `numpy` or `pandas`.

Think of Brython as a **scratchpad for Python ideas**, not a full development tool.

## When to Move Beyond Brython

As your programs become more advanced, youâ€™ll need a proper development setup. Thatâ€™s why this book also shows you how to install Python, use editors like VS Code, and run your code in a terminal or IDE.

> ðŸ§ª **Quick Tip**: Brython is perfect for testing ideas, especially early on. But for larger programs, move to a real Python environment so you can access everything Python has to offer.
