# Using IDLE

**IDLE** is the default editor that comes with most Python installations. It’s a lightweight, beginner-friendly environment designed to help you write, run, and debug Python code with minimal setup.

If you installed Python from the official website, IDLE was likely included automatically.

## Opening IDLE

### On Windows
- Search for **IDLE (Python x.x)** in the Start Menu.
- Click to open it. You’ll see a window that looks similar to the Python REPL.

### On macOS
- Open **Launchpad**, then search for **IDLE**.
- You can also run it from Terminal using:

```bash
idle3
```

### On Linux
You may need to install it first:

```bash
sudo apt install idle3
```

Then run:

```bash
idle3
```

## What Can You Do in IDLE?

IDLE has two main parts:

### 🟢 The Shell Window
- Acts just like the interactive terminal (REPL).
- Lets you test small pieces of code one line at a time.

### 📝 The Editor Window
- You can write full Python scripts here and save them as `.py` files.
- To open a new editor window: `File → New File`
- To run a script: `Run → Run Module` or press `F5`

## Pros of Using IDLE

- No setup required—just install Python and go.
- Built-in syntax highlighting.
- Simple error messages.
- Works well for basic programs and learning.

---

## Limitations of IDLE

- No extensions or plug-ins like VS Code.
- Not great for managing large projects.
- Limited features compared to professional editors.

> 💡 **Tip**: IDLE is great when you’re just starting out. Once you feel more comfortable, you may want to move to a more powerful editor like VS Code.

## Summary

If you’re brand new to programming, IDLE provides a low-friction way to get started. You can use it to practice everything you learn in this book—no additional tools required.
