# 1.2.2 Floats

Floats are numbers that include a **decimal point**, even if the decimal part is zero.

```python
pi = 3.14
price = 19.99
score = 5.0
```

Use floats when precision matters—like when you’re measuring instead of counting.

## Truncation Example

```python
value = int(3.9)  # result: 3
```

This **truncates** the decimal—it does not round up or down. Just chops it off!
