# 1.1 Introduction to Python Syntax

Python is known for having clean and readable syntax. This makes it an excellent first programming language. In this lesson, you'll learn the basic structure of Python code and how to write your first line of output using the `print()` function.

## What is Syntax?

**Syntax** refers to the structure and rules of a programming language. Just like grammar in English, syntax in Python tells the computer how to interpret what you've written. Python emphasizes simplicity and uses indentation to define structure.

## Indentation and Whitespace in Python

Unlike many languages that use braces `{}` to define code blocks, Python uses **indentation**. The amount of space at the beginning of a line is how Python knows what code belongs to what block.

Python allows either **spaces** or **tabs** for indentation—but you should never mix them in the same file. Doing so can lead to confusing errors.

```python
if True:
    print("This line uses spaces")
    print("This line uses a tab")  # This will cause an error in Python
```

To avoid these kinds of errors, always use **four spaces** per indentation level. Most code editors (including VS Code) will help you with this automatically.

In many programming languages, code blocks are defined with curly braces `{}`. In Python, indentation is used instead:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, CyberNet student!")
```

If you remove or misalign the indentation, Python will give you an error.

## Key Concepts

- `print()` displays output
- Strings must be in quotes (`"like this"`)
- Indentation is required for defining blocks

## Try It Yourself

```python
print("Welcome to Lesson 1.1!")
print("This is Python running in your browser.")
```

Modify the code above to print your own message. Don’t forget to include the quotation marks!
